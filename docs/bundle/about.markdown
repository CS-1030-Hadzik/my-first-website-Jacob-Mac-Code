# Family!

I met my wonderful wife in 2018 while we were both stationed in Guam. She’s incredible and for reasons I still can’t quite understand, she decided to stick around. We were married in May 2019, and a year later, in July 2020, we welcomed our daughter Evelyn. She’s a sensitive soul with a big heart, and watching her grow and discover the world has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

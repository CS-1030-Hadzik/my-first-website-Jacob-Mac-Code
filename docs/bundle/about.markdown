# Family!

I met my wonderful wife in 2018 while we were both stationed in Guam. She’s incredible and for reasons I still can’t quite understand, she decided to stick around. We were married in May 2019, and a year later, in July 2020, we welcomed our daughter Evelyn. She’s a sensitive soul with a big heart, and watching her grow and discover the world has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

## Airforce

In July 2014, I shipped off to Air Force basic training. I had some different plans for my military career at the time, but ultimately I became an aircraft mechanic. I maintained, troubleshot, and repaired the communication and navigation equipment on C-17s.

By May 2015, I arrived at my first duty station at Travis AFB, California. This is where I truly honed my skills and experienced life close to the mountains for the first time. California also introduced me to a passion for rock climbing, snowboarding, and a variety of other outdoor hobbies.

Near the end of 2016, I was assigned to Guam. Guam is a beautiful island, but many of my previous hobbies were not accessible there. I had to find new ways to stay active, which led me to snorkeling, scuba diving, and surprisingly, off-roading.

During my time in Guam, I had the opportunity to cross-train in other career fields, gaining experience working on C-5 aircraft. I also participated in two weeks of training with Security Forces and two weeks of fieldcraft hostile with the Combat Communications Squadron called Operation Dragon Forge. It was a challenging and rewarding experience.

I served in Guam until the conclusion of my Air Force career on July 11, 2021, and I look back on those years with pride, gratitude, and a sense of accomplishment.

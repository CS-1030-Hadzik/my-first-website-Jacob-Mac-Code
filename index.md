# Introduction:

    Hello, My name is Jacob McAleese. I have spent the last 11 years of my adult life in the military on active duty. After getting married, having a kid, and hopping to another branch of service I decided it was time to get out. If you would like to know a little more about me click [here](https://cs-1030-hadzik.github.io/my-first-website-Jacob-Mac-Code/about/). Otherwise, enjoy the random things I have added to this home page! 🐢
